**Currently in development until 31/12**


You just arrived at Frostlands! You were left here by your friendly tour guide but he forgot to mention there are 
evil snowmen lurking on the island! Fortunately for you there's enough snow around to create the deadliest of weapons:
the Snowball! Rid the lands of the snowmen so you can get to enjoy your holiday in peace.


### How to play:
- Install required libraries and packages as outlined in _requirements.txt_
- Run _main.py_
- Hunt down some snowmen!
